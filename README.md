A unit converter for those of us who are too lazy to convert parsecs-to-light-years in our heads.

Built as a static page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (notably the React.js library). Convert your units quickly and in style.

This is just a little project to get me up to speed with React.js (it's doing it's job so far). It doesn't have a backend so it can be bundles by webpack and served as a static file. I'll probably create a build job in Jenkins at some point so I can deploy faster.
