A unit converter for those of us who are too lazy to convert parsecs-to-light-years in our heads.

Built as a static page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (notably the React.js library). Convert your units quickly and in style.

This was just a little project to get me up to speed with React.js and give me an excuse to design something pretty (it did its job). It doesn't have a backend so it can be bundled by webpack and served as static files. ~I'll probably create a build job in Jenkins at some point so I can deploy faster~ I used a small build job in Jenkins to automate deployments.
